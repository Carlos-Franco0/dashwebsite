This code establishes a dashboard showing data on wind energy and other renewable energies. 
Using python we imported several libraries such as pandas, dash, and plotly. 
In order to make sure that the data was being pulled from CSV files and not created in the code we used several pd.read_csv() functions and assigned them corresponding variables.
Using plotly we were able to create a heat map of the U.S. which shows energy hot spots.
Also while using plotly we were able to make several other graphs with different collections of data based off of wind energy or renewable energy comparison.
In order to create the dashboard itself we used the dash library which gives us access to flask (a python web application development tool) and html (a website creator).
Overall this project was used to test our groups knowledge of programming and teamwork.
Lessons were learned and mistakes were definitely made, but this is an experience we will hold closely.
